I sit in my chapel
my sanctuary from expectation, from judgment, from uncertainty
I revel in the roaring silence of my mind
all the chaos from the world around me sometimes becomes so ordinary
and I need to create my own music
as the quiet speaks to my thoughts in its native tongue 
to be exposed to me at points in my life
yet to be experienced.
